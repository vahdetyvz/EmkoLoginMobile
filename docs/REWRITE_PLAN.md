# Rewriting Plan

This project is being restructured to improve maintainability.
The major steps are:

1. Adopt a feature-based folder structure under `lib/`.
2. Introduce state management using `flutter_bloc` with clear separation of UI and logic.
3. Create dedicated modules for authentication and home pages.
4. Write unit and widget tests for critical components.
5. Clean up obsolete files and follow the lints defined in `analysis_options.yaml`.

This document will be updated as progress is made.
